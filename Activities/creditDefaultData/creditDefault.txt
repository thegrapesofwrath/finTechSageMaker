Now its your turn! With the help of your partners try to apply the same data analysis 
technique to the creditDefault data set. The target column for a model is TARGET.

Try to answer the following questions:

How many columns have categorical variables?

Which columns have categorical variables?

How many unique values are their for each categorical column?

Do any columns have missing data? If so try to fill in the missing values.

Which columns most strongly correlate with the TARGET column?
